Other Notes
Player
Press and hold Shift+Alt to skim - scrub/seek using the horizontal position of the mouse cursor 
without clicking and dragging.
When a filter has a rectangular visual control:
Hold Shift to move it (change Position).
IMPORTANT: You must first click somewhere inside the rectangle to give it focus.
Hold Ctrl (command on macOS) to constrain movement to be strictly horizontal or vertical.
Hold Alt (option on macOS) to suspend snapping when the grid/guides are turned on.
All of the above keys can be combined.
Timeline
While dragging shot or trimming, press and hold Alt (option on macOS) to temporarily suspend snapping.
 On Linux, pressing Alt before 
dragging will usually move the app window; so, press Alt after you start dragging.
Press and hold Shift+Alt to skim - scrub/seek using the horizontal position of the mouse cursor without clicking and dragging.
Double-click a fade in/out control (circle) to toggle it between one second and none.
Hold Ctrl (command on macOS) while dragging one side of a marker to change its duration.
Multiple Selection in Playlist and Timeline
To select a range (multiple consecutive clips) click the first (or last) clip, press and hold Shift and 
click the last (or first) clip.
To select or deselect multiple clips individually hold Ctrl (command on macOS) while clicking the clips.
Keyframes
Hold Ctrl (command on macOS) while dragging a keyframe to lock the time and change only its value.
Hold Alt while dragging a keyframe to lock the value and change only its time.
Double-click a regular keyframe curve/line to add or remove a keyframe. (Not all parameters support a 
curve/line for its keyframes.)
Double-click a simple keyframe to toggle it between one second and none.
Mouse Wheel
Player
Press and hold the wheel and drag to pan the view when zoomed in.
When a filter has a rectangular visual control:
The wheel zooms in/out.
Hold Ctrl (command) to rotate.
Hold Alt (option on macOS) to suspend snapping to 0, 90, 180, 270, or 360 degrees.
Playlist
scroll vertically
use Alt to scroll horizontally
Timeline and Keyframes
scroll horizontally*
use Alt to scroll vertically
press and hold the wheel to drag (scroll) the view
use Shift to change track height
use Ctrl (command on macOS) to zoom in/out
* NOTE: On macOS, in order to scroll Timeline or Keyframes horizontally with a mouse wheel (not Magic Mouse or
 track pad), you must also use one of the following:

control (not command)
control+option
control+command
option+command
Player
Numeric Fields
Numeric fields can be incremented and decremented using the mouse wheel as long as the mouse pointer is over it. On some 
versions holding Ctrl (command on macOS) incremenents and decrements more (10x the normal, depends on decimal digits).

Entering Time Values
Timecode fields—such as the prominent one at the bottom of the player—do not require you to enter a full timecode value. 
There are some short-hand ways to enter time values. First of all, a number with no colons (e.g., 100) is a frame number. 
Remember, frame numbers start at 0; so 100 is the 101-th frame! Including a colon (:) makes it interpret as timecode 
(HH:MM:SS:FF where FF = frames) or a clock value (HH:MM:SS.MS where MS = milliseconds or any fraction of a second).
 The difference between the two is that the last field is delimited by a colon or decimal point (a comma in some locales).
  Next, not all of the fields of the time value need to be included. For example, you can enter “::1.0” for one second.
   However, not all of the separators need to be included - they are evaluated from right-to-left. Thus, for 
   our example, “1:” is short for one second; however, “:1.0” or “:1.” is also one second but not “1.0” because it does 
   not contain a colon. “:1.5” is one and a half seconds. “1::” is one minute. “1:30:” is one minute and thirty seconds. “1:::” is one hour.
